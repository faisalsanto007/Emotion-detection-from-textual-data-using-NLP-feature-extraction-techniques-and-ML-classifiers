# Emotion detection from textual data using NLP feature extraction techniques and ML classifiers
 This model was prepared for my undergrad thesis. Firstly, we gathered dataset and then sorted it according to certain categories. Then we applied NLTK, textblob for text pre-processing and Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction. Finally used 4 ML classifiers to train and test our dataset.
